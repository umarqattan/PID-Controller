# CarND-Controls-PID
Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program

---

## Reflection

* The goal of this project was to implement a PID controller in C++ as an extension to Udacity's Self-Driving Car Engineer Nanodegree Program project, Behavioral Cloning. To recap on the Behavioral Cloning project, I trained a car to drive around a few tracks so that it could drive itself with the use of Deep Learning (implmented a Convolutional Neural Network to train a car to drive itself on the track). In this project, I implemented a PID controller so that the simulated car can navigate a test track successfully at relatively high speeds.

## PID Controller

* The PID controller updates proprotional error, integral error, and derivative error depending on the position of the simulated car relative to the track, and a method to update the steer value based on the sum of the errors of the PID. With a bit of trial and error, I tuned the P, I, and D parameters of the PID contorller 

  * P: Proportional Coefficient
    * If this parameter is tuned in such a way that it surpasses 0.4, the steering angle makes it so that car nearly veers off the track right at the beginning of the track session. Anything between 0.2 and 0.3 ensures the car doesn't steer too significantly. When P is set to 0.25, the car is able to steer safely around the track and the car's movement looks rather smooth.
  * I: Integral Coefficient
    * If this parameter is tuned in such a way that it surpasses 0.0001, the car turns radically and jumps off the track quickly. This number could be zero and would still drive around the track safely.
  * D: Differential Coefficient
    * If this parameter is tuned in such a way that it surpasses 5.0, the car's turns are more fine. The smaller the number, the longer the delay between turns, which can make movements jerky. When the parameter is set to 10.0, each chance the track changes angle, the car's steering angle adjusts slightly at the right time it seems, even if it's a small adjustment. This ensures for safe driving.

There's an experimental patch for windows in this [PR](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-PID-Control-Project/pull/3)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./pid`. 

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

## Editor Settings

We've purposefully kept editor configuration files out of this repo in order to
keep it as simple and environment agnostic as possible. However, we recommend
using the following settings:

* indent using spaces
* set tab width to 2 spaces (keeps the matrices in source code aligned)

## Code Style

Please (do your best to) stick to [Google's C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html).

## Project Instructions and Rubric

Note: regardless of the changes you make, your project must be buildable using
cmake and make!

More information is only accessible by people who are already enrolled in Term 2
of CarND. If you are enrolled, see [the project page](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/f1820894-8322-4bb3-81aa-b26b3c6dcbaf/lessons/e8235395-22dd-4b87-88e0-d108c5e5bbf4/concepts/6a4d8d42-6a04-4aa6-b284-1697c0fd6562)
for instructions and the project rubric.

## Hints!

* You don't have to follow this directory structure, but if you do, your work
  will span all of the .cpp files here. Keep an eye out for TODOs.

## Call for IDE Profiles Pull Requests

Help your fellow students!

We decided to create Makefiles with cmake to keep this project as platform
agnostic as possible. Similarly, we omitted IDE profiles in order to we ensure
that students don't feel pressured to use one IDE or another.

However! I'd love to help people get up and running with their IDEs of choice.
If you've created a profile for an IDE that you think other students would
appreciate, we'd love to have you add the requisite profile files and
instructions to ide_profiles/. For example if you wanted to add a VS Code
profile, you'd add:

* /ide_profiles/vscode/.vscode
* /ide_profiles/vscode/README.md

The README should explain what the profile does, how to take advantage of it,
and how to install it.

Frankly, I've never been involved in a project with multiple IDE profiles
before. I believe the best way to handle this would be to keep them out of the
repo root to avoid clutter. My expectation is that most profiles will include
instructions to copy files to a new location to get picked up by the IDE, but
that's just a guess.

One last note here: regardless of the IDE used, every submitted project must
still be compilable with cmake and make./
